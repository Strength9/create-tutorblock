# Create Tutor Block

> Quickly create a new [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) Block that uses [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) (ACF) and utilises block.json and block-specific CSS and PHP files.

If you use ACF and make Gutenberg blocks, this simple utility should save you time scaffolding custom blocks.


## Quick Start

Install globally via npm:

```sh
npm install --global create-tutorblock
```

then navigate to where you want your block to be (i.e. /theme/blocks/), and run:

```
$ create-tutorblock
```
